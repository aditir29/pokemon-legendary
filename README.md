Understanding Pokémon stats and building a model to predict a Legendary Pokémon.

## Outline

This analysis is focused on understanding pokémon battle stats and legendary pokémon. Additionally I will applying machine learning methods to build the best classifier. 
Precisely, I am interested in classifying the legendary status of a given pokémon. 


The outline of the data project is as follows:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
	- Identifying strongest Pokémon
	- Understanding behaviours and correlations
2. Modeling
	- Feature Engineering
	- Model Building
	- Model Prediction
	- Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Refit
